## Maximizing efficiency using parallelization

Is your python, R, or Matlab code taking forever to run on your laptop? If so, you may be able to parallelize your code, such that multiple steps of your workflow can be executed simultaneously, greatly reducing the time-to-solution.

This RC Quick Byte* provides an example-based introduction to the fundamentals of parallelization, to help you determine if parallelization may benefit your research workflow. Future modules in the CURC Parallelization series will cover parallelization for specific applications and languages.

_Whatâ€™s an RC Quick Byte?: An RC Quick Byte is a 20-30 minute session intended to provide essential information about a specific topic. You can expect to leave a 'Quick Byte' with the information you need to apply a tool, service, or concept._
